# OSI Model 

## Application layer 

- Deals with network applications and application layer protocols (more on this later). 

## Transport layer 

- Provides the application layer with the following functionality: transporting messages between application end systems (host to server). 

## Network layer 

- Helps the transport layer with routing of messsages - specific functionalities such as error handling, routing, (dis)assembly, etc. 

## Link layer 

- Transport of packets between individual nodes (packet switches). 

## Physical layer 

- Transport of individual bits two nodes. 
- Different protocols are in place for various types of physical media (this will be an interesting topic to read up on).
