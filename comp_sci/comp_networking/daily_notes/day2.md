# Definitions 

## Packets 

* Circuit switched networks have buffers and transmission rates reserved for the entire duration of the connection. 
* Packet switched networks allocate these resources dynamically, based on the needs of each network. 

## Frequency

* FDM shares the resources of the connection among different frequencies.
	* Cannot allocate frequencies dynamically, changes may lead to interference. 
* TDM divides the connection into frames, each frame is divided into equally spaced slots, and each connection is allocated a seperate slot. 
	* Better for dynamic allocation, busier connections can be given more time slots. 

# Summary

This chapter mainly gives a high level overview of the concepts that will be discussed at length later on in the book. It also serves as an introduction to the concept of delays and how this affects packet switching and routing.
