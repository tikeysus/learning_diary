# John Wick 4 Movie Review 

As expected, the action was great, the scenes were perfectly choreographed as was the stuntwork. The casting was superb, each character had a significant impact on the plot. This made the dialogue better throughout the movie. Credit has to be given to the actors that displayed great martial arts skills as well as entertaining shooting abilities. Not to forget, immense credit needs to be given to the scenery of the movie, it spanned across multiple continents; as a viewer I truly felt like I was situated in these environments along with the characters.  

That's about it when it comes to the positives. 

To me, the movie completely disregarded realism. Suits with built-in bullet vests are cool, but how much damage can the human body take? Rolling down a set of 222 stairs after countless sleepless nights and dehydrated days, jumping off fatal heights but still being ready for combat only pertains to the fictional world. 

The public in the John Wick universe seems to be completely oblivious to what is going on around them, they would watch dozens of people being murdered and still not care. It also seems as though the public is only comprised of two groups - assassins and regular people. It's strange when dozens of people get murdered in the most populous metropolises in the world and no signs of police are present, not even the faint of sirens.

The plot of the movie took itself too seriously. The first movie in the franchise was simple, and had a set purpose. After each iteration, John would face enemies that were more and more powerful; the series underwent the Fast and Furious evolution of just making shit up for the sake of it. 

Overall, I was glad that I watched the movie purely for entertainment value. 

Final rating: 6/10
